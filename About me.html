            <h1>Know more about me</h1>
            <h5>I am Antonio Latrelle Santa cruz Tantiado</h5>
            <h4>born on 17 of October 2006</h4>
            <p> My name <q>Antonio</q> came from my late motherside grandfather which is named Eduardo Antonio R. Santa cruz,
                I grew up living with my grandparents because of my father working overseas and a broken family.
                <br> I am the third of four siblings in which i am the only male in the family aside from my father and grandfather.
                <br> I lived under the care of my uncles, unties, grandparents and our Yaya which has been with us for 19 years straight and treated me and my siblings as a daughter of hers.
            </p>
            <p>
                <br>
                     Growing up may be hard but we got a lot of helped from our family.
                <br> When i was a kid i am the naughtiest of the family and i often get in to trouble.
                <br> As a kid really love animals and i very often adopt stray dogs but my family disaproves with it, but then they also gaved me a puppy that came from my cousin,
                I named him Olaf, he is a half Shih Tzu and half Aspin dog, he stayed with us and moved with my stepmother.
                <br> during those times(i think it's around grade 2-3) my stepbrother likes to keep exotic animlas as pets in which i got the influence of having one as well, We've handled a lot of exotic pets such as Tarantula's, Scorpions and other insects like Centipedes,
                we've also kept Hedgehogs, Guinea pigs and one of my favorites Hamsters, I've adopted 7-10 Hamsters but sadly they all died one by one.
                <br> When we moved from a different home with my stepmother along with my dog Olaf my father introduced us with two more puppies Cooper a mix of st. bernard and a husky and Lily a full breed Golden Retriever
                we moved back to my grandparents and left Olaf to my stepmothers care but we'ved bringed Cooper along with us but unfortunately we can handle his behavior and got him back with my stepmother.
                <br> When my Father and Stepmother splited my father have brought Lily to us and stayed with, Lily Stayed with us for more than 4 years but sadly died during my 2nd year High School. 
            </p>
            <p>
                <br> Over the past years i've been into some schools due to other reasons.
                <br> Talking about School, in my nursery year i've studied in Devine Light Academy, then in my Kinder to 3rd Grade I've studied in Devine Jesus Learning Center,
                    and on my 1st-2nd quarter of my 4th Grade i've studied in Kabisig Elementary School located in Cainta Rizal and then moved back to Bacoor Cavite in which i'ved
                    finished my 3rd-4th Quarter 4th Grade to 6th Grade.
                <br> I finished High School in Bacoor National High School Villa Maria Annex in which i've met many many friends.
                <br> This School had made me who i am today and I'm very very proud in the friends that i met and stayed with me until now.
                <br> I am also extremely proud of the teachers that i met and i seriously will never forget them especially my grade 7 and grade 10 advisers ma'aam Juane and ma'am Gina
                    who have served as a mother to me and help me with my strugles in studies or in school, I would never ever gonna forget the two of them even if i grew up as succesful person.
                <br> and now here I am studying in SHS in as a Grade 11 ICT Programming student.
            </p>
            <p>
                <br> Talking about the strand and that i am studying right now,
                <br> At first I am really not interested in Programming and I wanted to take the Computer Servicing track in which i am very skilled and aligned in my hobby building computers,
                    but I've also thinked that if i pursued Computer Servicing it would only be a waste of time because it is not that very interesting and very easy to learn so i persued Computer Programming and
                    now i'm contented with track.
